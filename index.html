                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking 
                that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may 
                be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, 
                skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, 
                or other extreme sports.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal 
                or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of 
                knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

            <p class="content">
                Parachuting and skydiving is a method of transiting from a high 
                point in the atmosphere to the surface of Earth with the aid of 
                gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using 
                a parachute or parachutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                For human skydiving, it may involve a phase of more or less free-falling 
                (the skydiving segment) which is a period when the parachute has not yet 
                been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal
                <br><br>
                For cargo parachuting, the parachute descent may begin immediately, such 
                as a parachute-airdrop in the lower atmosphere of Earth, or be significantly 
                delayed, such as in a planetary atmosphere where an object is descending 
                "under parachute" following atmospheric entry from space, and may begin 
                only after the hypersonic entry phase and initial deceleration that occurs 
                due to friction with the thin upper atmosphere.

                Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which 
                use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is 
                often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with 
                risk is often a part of the experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if 
                not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet 
                (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled 
                by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.
                <br><br>
                Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be 
                fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a 
                competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting 
                championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting 
                Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all 
                aspects of the sport.

            <p class="content">
                Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. 
                Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious 
                pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking long distances for a 
                spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.

                Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "walking" is 
                used in these regions for shorter, particularly urban walks. In the United Kingdom 
                and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" describes all forms of walking, 
                whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps.
                <br><br>
                The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling, hillwalking, 
                and fell walking (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). The term 
                bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers 
                club in 1927.In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called tramping.

            </div>
            <p class="content">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), 
                uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually 
                carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean 
                shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the 
                form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
